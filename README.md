## The project predicts the language of the data entered.
#### Machine learning modules are used that are present in Python. Mainly focusing on implementing Scikit-learn, to help the machine learn as it translates sentences.
#### This model uses 4:1 ratio for training and testing itself, where it uses 80% percent of the information to train itself and the rest 20% to test itself  see how it performs. As its knowledge base increases the information that it has, to train itself also increases, in turn giving more accurate results.
#### In the model that we will be building we are using Bayes theorem to predict the language in which the given text is. By using Bayes theorem, we are increasing the accuracy of our language prediction.
