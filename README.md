# Occipital

## Overview
Occipital is a machine learning project designed to predict the language of the input text data. The project leverages the Scikit-learn library in Python and utilizes Bayes theorem to enhance language prediction accuracy.

## Features
- **Language Detection**: Predicts the language of a given text using machine learning models.
- **Efficient Training and Testing**: Uses an 80:20 training-to-testing ratio to ensure reliable performance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CR1502/Occipital.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the `LanguagePredictor.py` script to start predicting languages.
- Input a sentence or paragraph to get the predicted language.

## How It Works
- The model is trained using a dataset containing multiple languages and uses Bayes theorem to classify text into different languages.
- As the training data increases, the modelâ€™s accuracy improves, providing better predictions over time.
